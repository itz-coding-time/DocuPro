🛠 Features

*Standardized Documentation: Generates HR-ready statements matching corporate DOCX schemas for immediate submission.

*Intelligent Roster Management: Specialized parser for "Gross" Sheetz Weekly Schedule exports that filters for night-shift associates automatically.

*The Ghost Protocol: Logic-based visibility that hides associates from the active roster once they have been sent home or dismissed for the shift.

*Shift-Aware Logic: Handles the unique "Time-Travel" math of overnight shifts (e.g., ensuring 2:00 AM Tuesday is correctly logged under Monday's shift).

*Local Persistence: Data is stored locally via GSON, ensuring your logs survive reboots without requiring cloud infrastructure.
